Introduction
For many teachers, every day is a bit of a coin toss.
 Some wonder,
“What kind of day is it going to be?” Maybe they hope that today will
be one of those “good days”—a day when they actually get through the
prepared lesson, they don’t have any emotional babysitting to do, and,
if its a really good day, the students actually learn something.

If only there was more to it than just having a “lucky day” every now
and then.
 The “not-so-lucky” days leave teachers wondering whether
all the work is worth it.
 The good days fuel their passion for teaching
and the love they have for the students.
 The question asked the most
usually starts with “why.
”
Understanding how the brain works may be one of the most relevant
areas of knowledge for educators today.
 Everything you do uses your
brain, and everything at school involves students’ brains.
 And, luckily,
our old way of schooling is fading fast as our understanding of the
brain increases.
 This is great news for tired teachers whose passion and
efforts don’t always yield the results they want.
 The more you understand
about the brain and how it works, dte better you can be at the
profession you care so deeply about.

This is also great news for students.
 Humans are born with a deep
curiosity and a drive to learn new things.
 Unfortunately, our old way
of schooling typically squashed much of this drive, which is probably
why you don’t see too much of it in your students today.
 There is
hope for a return to a way of schooling that embraces students’ natural
curiosity and way of learning.
 It is called brain-based learning,
and it begins with understanding the organ that drives all learning:
the brain.

Brain-based education is learning in accordance with the way the
brain is naturally designed to learn.
 It is based on solid research from
brain-related disciplines.
 It is not “tips and tricks,” methodologies
1
BRAIN-BASED LEARNING
based on myths, a well-meaning mentor teacher, or “junk science.
”
It is a multidisciplinary approach built on the fundamental question
“What is good for the brain?” It is also a way of thinking about learning.

It is a way of upholding your responsibility as an educator.

Brain-based education considers how the brain learns best.
 The brain
does not learn on demand according to a school’s rigid, inflexible
schedule.
 It has its own rhythms. If you want to maximize learning,
you first need to discover how your students’ natural learning engine
operates.
 Many classroom elements we used to think were critical to
learning may, in fact, not be very important at all.

Why This Matters
The brain is poorly designed for formal instruction.
 In fact, it is not
at all designed for efficiency or order.
 Rather, it develops best through
selection and survival of, first, what is effective, and, then, over time,
what is efficient.
 If a particular knowledge, skill, or attitude serves your
survival and prosperity, your brain will prioritize that knowledge, skill,
or attitude over another, less successful one.

Teachers and school leaders across the globe are rethinking our old
models of instruction, which proposed that the best means of molding
individuals was operant conditioning (through rewards and punishments).

This line of thought was popularized in the 1950s and is still
promoted in some schools today.
 As an example, some school leaders
believe the best way to reduce school violence is to build high fences,
install metal detectors, reduce student-to-student contact, stiffen the
rules, and have a police presence on campus.
 The associated “three
strikes and you’re out” type of policies have been shown to be dangerously
short-sighted.
 In 2007, a school in Fairfax County, Virginia,
banned all physical contact, including high-fives, between students.

The school did not permit a student to touch another, or a teacher to
pat a student on the back, or anyone to get a hug.
 This is an example
of a good intention gone horribly wrong.

But humans are creative and emotional; some kids will try to beat the
system, and others will just plain get resentful or shut off any love of
learning.
 A more brain-based approach would be to increase classroom
engagement, greet all students with a smile, increase (not decrease)
social connectedness, and boost involvement in school activities like
martial arts, theater, music, and ballroom dancing.

Adamant “old school” policymakers still insist that achieving the
highest possible rank in test scores (instead of producing happy,
INTRODUCTION
well-adjusted human beings who can think critically, care about
others, and innovate) should be the top priority in our school systems.

This means that, as teachers, we must be able to care for our students
better and help them succeed with less wasted effort, fewer distractions,
and greater focus.

Brain-based learning reminds us that if we want things to be better,
we’ll need to be better informed about the brain.
 We will need to see
what happens when we do this instead of that.
 Brain research can
help us understand learning at a much deeper level.
 We’ll show you
what we mean.
 A student whose brain activity matched the image on
the right in Figure A.
1 would likely be acting de-motivated. Teachers
who didn’t know better might assume the student was disinterested.

But this type of brain inactivity may be consistent with chronic stress
disorder.
 That’s a far cry from being lazy or disinterested.
Our students are not lab rats; they are, of course, human beings.
 To
account for their human propensity to be creative, depressed, oppositional,
and motivated, as well as to make conscious choices, we have to
take a more sophisticated approach.
 Consideration must be given to
these factors and the diversity of our students’ experiences and backgrounds.

How, then, would you integrate a simple behavioral reward/
punishment system with such diverse human learners? Shouldn’t the
student who is living with abuse, rage, brain insults, or distress, for
instance, be evaluated on an individual basis? How can educators
possibly account for all of these differences? The answer is that we

BRAIN-BASED LEARNING
cant—at least, not with a simple model that uses either a carrot or a
stick to motivate learning.
 The vast range of learners in todays classrooms
are subjected typically to one of the following three models.

Survival of the fittest.
 “You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t
make it drink.
” This old adage reflects the thinking of some educators
that their responsibility ends at leading the proverbial horse (their
students) to water.
 Thus, if children don’t learn to read in the standard
program provided, then the children are deficient.
 The thinking
is that if students can’t cut it (or don’t want to), that’s their problem.

This model reduces the teacher’s accountability and allows many
learners to “fall through the cracks.
”
Determined behaviorist.
 “With enough punishment and rewards,
you can get any behavior you wish.
” This model basically views learners
as rats to be manipulated by the whims of the establishment.
 If test
scores are too low, teachers can essentially bribe students into achieving
higher ones.
 If school violence is a problem, then what we need is
more guards and metal detectors.
 This way of thinking manipulates
learners and reduces the classroom to a place where students have
little voice or choice.

More thoughtful and brain-based.
 “How can we make the horse
thirsty, so that it will want to drink from the trough?” This shift in
thinking reflects the approach of brain-based educators.
 A teacher
following the brain-based model would ask herself, How could I
discover the learner’s natural impediments and built-in motivators so that
desired behavior emerges as a natural consequence?
Give the Brain a Balanced, Healthy
Learning Environment
Nature’s biological imperative is simple: No intelligence or ability will
unfold until, or unless, it is given the appropriate environment.
 From
a biological perspective, it is important to realize that the human
brain, like the immune system, is designed solely for survival.
 Thus,
students will do what they need to do to “survive” in the “schoolyard
jungle.
” The negative behaviors they learn—put-downs, deceit,
attacking, avoidance, and peer pressure—are to be expected as long as
students perceive that their survival is at stalte.
 This precept calls for
dramatic changes in the way we organize formal teaching and training.

As you continue to read this book, keep in mind this basic brain-
based principle: The brain is designed for survival, not typical formal
instruction.

INTRODUCTION
Having said that the brain operates naturally on a selection principle,
can it still learn through instruction? Of course it can.
 Every day,
learners worldwide develop new skills and knowledge based on a
brain-compatible model of instruction.

Brain-based education is about knowing why certain strategies work
better than others to create an optimal learning environment.
 Using
research-based practices is a responsibility of any professional.
 Keep
in mind that if you don’t know why you do what you do, it’s less purposeful
and less professional.
 Relying on common wisdom or experience—while
there’s nothing inherendy wrong with that—may lead to
ineffective teaching.

When you embrace the principles in this book, your professional life
will change.
 You will feel more energized, because you will experience
more success on a daily basis.
 You will find it easier to teach your
students challenging topics.
 You will have fewer behavior challenges
to deal with.
 You will prepare lessons more purposefully, and it will
become easier.
 You will design assignments that feel meaningful to
both you and your students.
 You will better know what to teach, how
to teach it, and why it is important.
 As you read this book, you may
notice thar certain topics and strategies crop up in more than one
place.
 Influences on learning can and do overlap, due to the highly
interconnected nature of the brain.

You are not the only one who will benefit from this journey toward
a more brain-friendly approach to teaching.
 Your students will ultimately
be the grand beneficiaries.
 As you embrace and teach in ways
supported by our current knowledge of the brain, your students will
be more motivated to learn, give more effort to learning tasks, and
retain information better.
 Ultimately, when they are taught in a way
that is aligned with their brains’ natural way of learning, they will
connect with an old, yet familiar feeling: the joy of learning.

Great things are in store for you and your students; let’s get started.

Fundamentals of
Brain-Based Learning
Chapter 1: How the Brain Usually Learns
Chapter 2: Why Each Brain Is Unique
How the Brain
Usually Learns
It’s likely you have planted something in your life.
 I have been through
my “trial and error” share of flowers, bushes, trees, fruits, and vegetables.

Some have been a success, and others were a spectacular failure.

My wife says I am a plant hobbyist (vs.
 a farmer), and she’s right.
There are a surprising number of similarities between plants and
the brain.

If you’re an amateur horticulturist like me, in order for your plants to
flourish you need the tight context (good soil, good weather, the right
surrounding vegetation, your well-being).
 You also need the right
triggers (e.
g., water) to start the growing process, ongoing processes
(the seasons, pest eradication, fertilizer, etc.
), systems (routines and
devices to automate the watering, managing die sunlight and frost),
and structures (the sturdiness of die plant itself, staking up the plant,
pruning, fencing, grafting, harvesting fruit or vegetables, etc.
).
Every time I write all these out, it gets overwhelming.
 I can see why
many of my gardening “adventures” end up with dismal results.
 Its
not easy.
 But most successful farmers just had to learn one at a time.
Now, given the complexity of this chapter’s tide, it wuuld be easy to
overwhelm even the most determined reader.
 Toward that end, this
chapter will be a bit unusual and even more practical than you imagined.

After all, you’re more interested in how to help your students
learn better than you are in getting your plants to grow well.
 So, for
starters, let’s define learning.

9
10 CHAPTER 1
What Is Learning?
Learning is che process of acquisition of new (or the modification of
existing) knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences (Gross,
2012).
 This definition does two things. First it reminds us that there
must be some evidence of the learning, even if the evidence is a quiet,
implicit bias.

Second, it allows for a portion of the learning to be beyond our cognitive
awareness.
 Any given experience may influence our values, behaviors,
or preferences, even if we don’t recognize it at the time.
 As an
example, a student may dislike a teacher but not always be able to tell
you why he or she feels that way.

When someone says to you, “This is how the brain learns,” specificity
is critical.
 Putting your hand (accidentally) on a hot stove is one form
of learning.
 Hopefully, you would not do that again. Shaking someone’s
hand can be a learning experience.
 Maybe they squeeze too hard
or their hand is a bit sweaty and you wonder why.
 Drawing a hand by
tracing it is also learning.
 Explaining how a hand works to an infant
is pretty difficult, so you demonstrate.
 Doing surgery on a hand is a
learning experience in the early days of a doctors residency.
 In short,
there are many, many ways to learn.
 This chapter will focus on the
core processes typical to learning of any kind.

Third, the complexity of the brain can be overwhelming.
 Over time,
researchers have discovered that greater, not less, complexity is the rule.

And since all learning is connected to the brain in some way, it is tough
to encapsulate a brain-based approach.
 Maybe the best way to define
brain-based education is through three words: engagement, strategies,
and principles.
 Brain-based education is the engagement of strategies
based on principles we currently believe to be true about the brain.

HOW THE BRAIN USUALLY LEARNS
Learning's Big Five Players
Since we all want better strategies for learning, now you see that we
have to back up a bit to learn the principles.
 The foundation to this
chapter is your understanding of how five “players" in your students’
brains can help inform your understanding of their learning.
 These
five players are context, triggers, processes, systems, and structures.

In its most simple form, here is how we commonly (but not
always) learn:
All learning happens somewhere (the context).
 You are with friends,
or not.
 You are indoors or outdoors. You are in school or at home. You
are feeling healthy, or not.
 In short, the “place” you are in is a huge
regulator of the learning process.
 If you are sick, angry, hungry, and
feeling hopeless, that is a socio-biological context for poor learning.

At school, we hope to always influence the environment (and the student)
to be in a positive context for the brain to grow.

The next “player” in the learning “chain” are the triggers (internal
or external) that activate a process (e.
g., listening to a conversation,
recoiling from a loud sound) that involves one or more larger systems
(emotional, cognitive, sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways,
etc.
) running through multiple structures (peripheral nervous
system, prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, amygdala, etc.
) in the brain
(Dang, O’Neil, & Jagust, 2012).

Since the “learning” has obviously been simplified here, lets dig down
a bit to make some sense of it.

The end “product” of this five-player sequence is learning, a physical
change in the brain that typically constitutes a memory.
 When it
comes to certain types of learning (e.
g., the development of a subtle
bias), however, we are not sure how and where that learning is stored
(Robertson, 2018).
 Learning may manifest itself as a new skill, new
content, or fresh insights (i.
e., something new that the learner is now
consciously aware of), or it may be an implicit shift that is stored until
it gets triggered someday.
 To ensure we can connect all this better to
our workday and the students we serve, let’s unpack this “five-player”
sequence just a litde more.

Context Situates the Learning
The list of potential influences on the learning that is about to begin
is huge.
 The following questions that may arise beneath learners’ consciousness
hint at the vast number of internal and external conditions
that can either enhance or inhibit the entire learning process:

• Is the learning relevant?
• Is there an urgency to learn it?
• Are my friends here for support?
• How do I feel today? Am I in peak health, or am 1 a bit
under the weather?
• Is the environment well-lit, is fresh air available, and are
nearby noises at a minimum?
• Do I have background knowledge on the topic?
• Is there water for hydration?
Triggers Start the Learning
The most obvious of the five players is the appearance of one or
more triggers.
 A trigger is a stimulus that may be internal or external.
Sometimes triggers arise within our own minds—for example,
in the form of a reflection, an insight, or an aha moment.
 Other
times, they come from outside.
 For example, the trigger for learning
might be a student seeing a poster, hearing a loud bang, asking a
question in class, reading about the subject, trying an experiment,
music playing, hearing a brief lecture, a curiosity “prompt” about
HOW THE BRAIN USUALLY LEARNS
new learning, sharing and listening with a partner, joining a new
social group, or writing a summar)'.
 Any of these events may initiate
a change in the brain.

We say “may" initiate a change, because the brain typically gets exposure
to countless bits of sensory data (from multiple sources), and
much of it is daily “noise.
” The things that are most likely to get your
attention or even “stick” relate to what you perceive as important in
your life.
 For our survival, the brain is designed to respond best to the
environmental signals that seem the most relevant (Ritchey, Murty,
& Dunsmoor, 2016).
 Something may stand out because it is fresh or
novel.
 But that won’t evoke change in your brain unless there is an
added “kicker” to it: relevance.
 Thus, many effective teachers use a
constant stream of relevance to hook their learners.

Classroom examples of triggers are countless.
 Greeting students at
the door can be a trigger for an upcoming good experience.
 Maybe
you lower your voice to draw in the students or tell a compelling
story.
 You might have a noisemaker to get attention (I often use a
wooden train whistle).
 You may flick the lights off for a moment.
You might play music when students arrive or use an energizer.
 You
might change your appearance with a hat or scarf, or you might play
the role of a famous (or infamous) person for a lesson.
 You might get
extra attention with a suspenseful pause, increased buy-in, or extra
relevance.

In short, nearly everything you do can be a trigger, if used properly.

Relevant content is a clear trigger for your students’ brains (Oudiette,
Antony, Creery, & Paller, 2013).
 The classroom triggers you provide
minute after minute, every day of the school year, are influencing
what you see and hear from students: and, just as important, their
brains are likely changing, too.
 Some of the changes are temporary,
and others may be more lasting.
 Embrace this new “superpower” as
an educator, and make it your goal to be more purposeful about what
triggers you employ, how, and when.

Processes Work Within Systems
The next part of the five-player process begins as your triggers activate
a process within a system.
 Critically, there is no one way that
all learning occurs.
 Some learning is nonconscious, like putting your
hand on a hot stove; some learning is like throwing an object to score
points; other learning is like listening to a conversation or reading.
 In
short, every different way the brain learns stimulates a different process
in the brain for learning.

CHAPTER 1
The most common and primary process for learning is the creation
of new connections between neurons.
 The trigger stimulus activates
an electrical signal, which originates in the cell body of the affected
neuron and runs down through the output (the axon).
 That electrical
signal stimulates the release of neurotransmitters from the end of the
axon out into the space between it and other neurons.

This space, known as a synapse, is a highly charged area where those
newly added neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, etc.
)
create a powerful messaging system.
 Those molecules are attracted to,
and may land in, the appropriately matched receptor sites on nearby
neurons’ “feelers,” known as dendrites for their tree-like shape.

At this part of the process, there is evidence for genetic contributions
to learning.
 For example, there is some (but not dramatic) evidence of
heritability for memory (Barr & Brito, 2013).
 There is evidence that
a genetic variation to increased dopamine at the synapses can induce
better learning (Pearson-Fuhrhop, Minton, Acevedo, Shahbaba, &
Cramer, 2013).

In summary, the most common form of learning is a perturbated,
stimulated cell that dispenses a message to another nearby cell via
the interactions in the synapse.
 So, the activity goes like this: output
axon (part of a neuron) releases a message via the synapse to a nearby
dendrite, which sends the new signal to its cell body.

Other processes might also include activating the somatosensory
pathways (a new thought may activate a “gut feeling"), the stress-
response pathway (an energizer activates heart rate, the hypothalamus,
adrenals, and gross motor muscles) (Herman, 2012), or attentional
pathways (a new thought in the prefrontal cortex, and multiple
parietal areas within cognitive systems that help the brain create
working memory) (Anderson et al.
, 2018). Or, maybe the change is a
sharp, new attentional orientation or an energizer activity (either may
raise norepinephrine and dopamine, along with increased blood flow)
(Chaddock-Heyman et al.
, 2016).
Each process that is activated above works within the confines of a
pre-existing system with the brain.
 But, as an educator, how do you
know what to do? You’ll want to be mindful of the brains process that
you’re triggering.
 Think through (in time, this will become automatic)
which pathway you want.

Lets say you want to foster sharper, more focused attention among
your students, to activate the brains own source of focus and long-term
memory.
 That means focus on activating your students’ sympathetic
HOW THE BRAIN USUALLY LEARNS
nervous system.
 Norepinephrine is the primary neurochemical used by
the body’s sympathetic nervous system (Hamill, Shapiro, &C Vizzard,
2012).
 It is a catecholamine (in the family of “uppers”) that functions
to get the brain and body ready for serious, urgent business.
 So, the
actions you use to initiate this process in students’ sympathetic nervous
system will be ramping up norepinephrine with triggers such
as urgency, risk, or excitement (e.
g., a timed assignment or energizer).
Focus on the specific triggers for this compound (excitement
or urgency) and let the magic begin.
 As you grow, you are going to
initiate much smarter, more specific kinds of input to impact a specific
process you want.

As a counterexample, let’s say you wanted a student to calm down.

You could make a very subtle change, such as using a quieter, soothing
voice, or you could organize a positive change in seating, which may
trigger the release of serotonin which is correlated with less aggression,
less anxiety and improved learning (Carhart-Harris & Nutt, 2017).

Here are descriptions of a few of your “systems.
” These include (but
are not limited to) your attentional system, your emotional pathways,
your stress response system, your gut biome, and your cognitive processing
pathways.

1.
 Your digestive system helps you turn the food you eat into
energy.
 This can affect your thinking and focus.
2.
 Your respiratory system helps you breathe. This can affect your
state of relaxation or anxiety.

3- Your nervous system (including your brain) controls other
body systems.
 For example, your cognitive capacity is part of
your nervous system.

4.
 Your circulatory system includes a transport system (blood)
and a pump (the heart) that keeps the blood moving.

5.
 Sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways typically fonction
as opposites.
 The sympathetic pathway “sympathizes” with the
“moment” and excites the nerves, to enable quick responses
to situations requiring immediate attention.
 Parasympathetic
pathways serve to maintain the status quo and promote rest
and relaxation.

6.
 Most of your body and mind systems work together.
(Examples are the respiratory and circulatory systems, the
muscular and skeletal systems, the digestive and circulatory
systems, and the nervous and digestive systems,)
CHAPTER 1
Systems Run Through Structures
Let’s begin with what you already know about structures.
 You may have
colleagues that assert their beginners’ knowledge about the brain by rattling
off words like “neuron,” “synapse,” “hippocampus,” and “prefrontal
cortex.
” Sorry, but that knowledge is rarely useful in the classroom.
Yes, the brain does have mosdy stable (but somewhat modifiable)
(Oakes, 2017) structures (cerebellum, frontal lobes, amygdala, temporal
lobes, gyri, nuclei, etc.
). But there’s a lot more to it, so lets dive in.
Most every process rims through multiple systems (sympathetic,
digestive, immune, etc.
) and engages not one, but multiple structures
(prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, amygdala, etc.
) in the brain
and body (Bogdanov et al.
, 2017). This is why it is often a fool’s game
to try to play “Where in the Brain?” when talking about a process like
learning or memory.

As an example, if you have eaten something drat did not agree with
you and you have a rumbling, upset stomach, can this make it hard
for you to pay attention? Of course.
 No doubt you see it happen
throughout the year with your own students.
 So, where then is the
problem—in your stomach or your brain? In short, yes, the mind/
body structures are the source of the processes, but no single structure

tells the story.
 It’s a bit like a huge traffic pileup—it can be difficult to
know for certain which car caused it all.

Learning (and Transfer) Is Our Goal
Figure 1.
3 is an overview and simplified adaption of a commonly
held model of how the brain stores what we learn (Camina & Güell,
2017).
 We have made some modest additions to the model to update
it.
 Later in the chapter, we present a more detailed version. But for
the moment, check out the ways the brains input starts to get learning
activated.
 As you can see in the illustration, there are only four known
ways for the brain to get or generate learning.

Four Types of Input: A Deeper Dive
Lets take a look at where the learning starts and walk through the
process to find out what happens in students’ brains.
 We will focus on
four of the main types of input, or starting points, for an experience
that results in some form of learning.

As far as scientists know (at least as of today), input to the brain
consists of:
1.
 existing input,
2.
 new sensory input,
3- new explicit declarative input (words and pictures), or
4.
 new implicit non-declarative input (Kump, Moskaliuk, Cress,
& Kimmerle, 2015).

Each of these types of input engenders a fully different learning experience,
and each has advantages and disadvantages in a school setting.

Pre-Existing Input
The first of the four input sources is simple: Use what you already
have in your brain and work with it to come up with something different
or better.
 Imagine you are quietly sitting on the couch, when
somehow your thoughts turn to the weird sounds your car has been
making for the past several days.
 As you sit reflecting on this, you
eliminate a handful of possible causes—its not this, its not that.
 . .
maybe its the.
... Because you have a decent consumers understanding
of cars, you are able to do some simple problem-solving or “learning”
within the confines of your own brain, without any “outside”
support or stimuli.
 New learning can begin when you simply think
18 CHAPTER 1
about something, reflect on an experience, or reframe something you
already know.
 In the overstimulated world we live in, this form of
input is often overlooked and undervalued.
 A tremendous amount of
brain activity and learning happens in the quieter moments of reflection.

Pre-existing input simply means you are using what you already
know to generate new insights, solutions, or action steps.

IN THE How can you maximize this form of input in the classroom? Here are a
CLASSROOM few suggestions to get you started:
• Have students brainstorm all the things that come to mind when
they think of___________(your current topic for learning).
 Then
have them reproduce these associations in some sort of graphic
organizer or visual collage.

• You can even orchestrate the use of pre-existing inputs in a social
way: A student can tell a partner something they already know
(or think they might know) about a given topic.
 Their partner then
responds with something they think of on that same topic.
 This
verbal back-and-forth with pre-existing inputs reengages relative
neural networks and primes the brain for further learning.

• Have students engage in a reflective free-writing activity in which
they list all associations they have with a particular topic.

Sensory Input
Sensory input refers to all of our senses—and some people believe
there are more than our famous five of touch, sight, hearing, smell,
and taste.
 Remember walking into your grandmothers home when
you were little and being met with that familiar smell that told you,
“Yep—were at Grandmas house”?That “learning” first occurred at an
earlier visit to Grandmas and was reinforced every subsequent time
you visited.
 Yet you may have also experienced thermoception (sense
of temperature), nociception (sense of pain), or equilibrioception
(sense of balance) that same special day.
 Much of what we learn is
prompted by some form of sensory input.
 Many parts of the brain
are responsible for sensory reception, including the hypothalamus.

The job of the hypothalamus is to assess the body’s condition (stress,
hunger, lighting exposure, thirst, etc.
) and signal the needed changes
(Xie & Dorsky, 2017).

HOW THE BRAIN USUALLY LEARNS 19
You may look out the window in the morning and SEE snow on the
ground.
 BAM! You just learned something about the weather for the day.
You walk back into your house after working on something in the garage
and SMELL dinner burning.
 BAM! Next, you just HEARD that you’re
going out to dinner tonight! Your brain is constandy receiving input from
sensory stimuli all around you.
 Ic is the context and intensity of those
sensory stimuli that impact the kind of learning they produce.

There was a prevailing theory in education for a while that students
learned best when material was presented to them in their dominant
sensory style, often called their “learning style” (Dekker, Lee,
Howard-Jones, & Jolles, 2012).
 At first, there were only a handful
of learning styles—visual, auditory, tactile/kinesthetic, and blends of
these three.
 Yet as of 2013, educators had gone on to identify a total
of 71 learning styles (Coffteld, 2013)! Yet many educators still adhere
to the practice of labeling students (Newton & Miah, 2017), even
though the claimed benefits of this approach were never supported
(Dekker et al.
, 2012) and we now have substantial evidence to
support a simple but profound idea: Learning is improved when
students receive input through multiple sensory channels within the
same learning experience (Schneider, Beege, Nebel, 6c Rey, 2018).

Here are a few ways you can utilize sensory input in your classroom.

• Maximize your physical learning space with purposeful visual
input: Write questions on the board to stimulate thinking; hang
posters summarizing previous lessons; provide a graphic overview
of the entire unit to give students the "big picture.
"
• Use a variety of sounds in your instruction—music, vocal accents.

Pause for emphasis before relating an important piece of
information; whisper occasionally to pique students' interest.

• During instruction in special subject areas, use special scents
(cinnamon, lavender, pine, etc.
) that may invite stronger
associations.

• Bring props (puzzles, items that reflect a particular period
of history, objects that enhance math understanding such as
manipulatives, etc.
) for students to hold, examine, and figure out.
And, yes, there are times when tasting can fit right in with a lesson
(such as a science lesson on acids, which taste sour, and bases,
which taste bitter) or a special time of year.

CLASSROOM
20 CHAPTER 1
Two Types of Explicit/Declarative Input
Recall the last time you sat in a workshop, watched a tutorial video
online, or listened to someone give you directions to a restaurant.

These are all declarative, or explicit, inputs (Eichenbaum & Cohen,
2014).
 They consist of facts, knowledge, stories, or experiences. They
are often categorized as either episodic learning or semantic learning.

Let’s start with episodic learning.

Episodic learning (the “where”) means your brain is designed
to remember the “address” where you experienced something
(Moscovitch, Cabeza, Winocur, &c Nadel, 2016).
 From a survival
perspective, the location of the event—Are you with friends or not?
Are you near food sources or not?—may be relevant.
 And if you ask
someone, “What did you have for dinner three nights ago?” the usual
response begins with, “Lets see, where did I have dinner that night?”
As this example illustrates, our brains often encode the content of
what we did with where we had the experience.
 Thinking back to the
place can help us remember the particulars of the event.
 And the more
intense our sense of that place or the stronger our associations with it
are, the better our recall is (Zeidman & Maguire, 2016).

Our brains form stronger memories of the “where” when it is less
“diluted.
” For example, you probably recall the first time you rode a
IN THE Episodic learning is continually occurring for you, because no matter
CLASSROOM where you are, you're in a specific place.
 That place might be at home in
your kitchen, at school at your desk, or in your car.
 So how do you take
advantage of the episodic capacity of the brain?
Stop "contaminating" the locations your students learn in and provide
more variety with greater distinctiveness and do it more often.
 To your
students, the "where" memory cue is not just a "what," such as "I
was at school today.
" It can be more precise: "I sat with my team and
worked on our math problems.
" Or, it could be, "I was up in front of the
class today sharing my story about how my grandparents from Vietnam
were involved in the war decades ago.
" To engage this capacity within
your students, periodically rotate where they sit in class.
 Use learning
stations.
 Ask students to take seven steps, partner up, and talk while
standing (vs.
 seated most of the time). Allow students to recreate
scenes from history or literature, or have them create skits in their
foreign language class.
 Any time students are acting something out,
they are engaging in episodic learning.

HOW THE BRAIN USUALLY LEARNS 21
bike beteer than che 389th time you rode a bike (unless there was an
emotional event).
 Novelty was key on the first bike ride, but much
less so on the later rides.
 Some might call this life-learning, or learning
that happens as you go about your daily activities.
 Literally everywhere
you go and everything you do is some sort «/"episodic input.

Semantic learning (the “what”) more closely resembles the structured
learning of facts, concepts, and knowledge about the world
we have acquired by means other than personal experience (Osada,
Adachi, Kimura, & Miyashita, 2008).
 These inputs—the names of
state capitals, elements of the periodic table, math facts—if not well
“packaged” with other forms of input, often stand alone as isolated
inputs in our classrooms.
 As a result, they are not very meaningful to
students, and recall tends to be weak.

All of this particular type of learning (declarative, semantic, explicit)
is word and picture-based.
 It means, “What did you see and hear?”
It is also the type most talked about, researched, referred to, and, of
course, tested.
 Why? It is the easiest to measure.
To support your students' word-based learning, use what the brain does
well.
 Teach students simple memorization skills. Teach students to act
out the content.
 But maybe the best technique (the one that is most
interesting to students and a strong aid to memory retention) is the
use of stories.
 Any time you can tell a story (especially an interesting
one) about the content you're teaching, you feed the brain's hunger for
meaning and tales.
 Have students create a story that personifies things
they're learning about in their math and science class (".
 . . and then
the electron said to the proton .
..'') to embed learning in an episodic
make-believe narrative.
 Students are traveling their semantic pathways
when they read a text or when they use flash cards to take in new math
facts, spelling words, or foreign vocabulary.

Implicit/Non-Declarative Input
You might be surprised how much “learning” is happening outside of
your conscious awareness or without direct instruction (Yang & Li,
2012).
 A student who unconsciously perceives a ceachers tone ofvoice
and body language to lack warmth has “learned” to not approach that
teacher for help.
 That is implicit learning. You are constantly picking
up on cues from your environment and the people around you as to
how you should feel or behave.
 For example, the darkness of an alley
may give you a twinge of apprehension and prompt you to take a

different route.
 Or the sound of laughter from the other side of the
room may make you curious enough to try to sec what’s so funny.
 Or
walking in on two people having an intense conversation may make
you feel uneasy and want to head right back out.

Play-embedded learning is a powerful way to utilize implicit learning.

Search the internet, or your colleague's repertoire, for activities and
games that facilitate learning.
 Students playing a dice game might
not recognize they are actually learning addition, multiplication, or
patterns.
 Have students compare, contrast, and discuss two similar
objects.
 They will implicitly be building their vocabulary and literary
skills.
 Teach students a song or a dance embedded with content
knowledge, life skills, or procedural tasks (e.
g., the five steps to
cleaning up after group work).

Researchers have labored for decades to sort out each of the many
types of learning (there are more than a dozen).
 The problem with
nearly all of the learning categories is that there is overlap (Wang,
Mao, Li, Lu, & Guo, 2016; Taylor, Krakauer, & Ivry, 2014)
As soon as you think you know what type of learning occurred, you
can label it.
 It was “another day at the park” (It was an environmental
experience, so it was episodic.
 Right?). Naturally, you can find it also
has qualities of another types of learning—definitely sensory, procedural,
implicit, and so on.
 By now you may have gotten enough clues
to realize that when someone uses the phrase “how the brain learns,”
your first question might now be, “Learns what?”
The difficulty in labeling a specific type of learning (and hence
describing the specific pathways it takes) is akin to trying to nail
Jell-0 to a tree.
 In addition, the learning ages, too. Some of what we
learned when we were younger (about monsters, Santa Claus, etc.
)
gets replaced with updated or more sophisticated models of understanding.

Other early learnings (e.
g., a traumatic experience) may lie
dormant yet still shape the rest of our lives.
 Some memories simply
fade due to lack of use.
 This is another way of saying rhat there’s a
timeline to most of our learnings as they become dormant, disappear,
or get revised as we move through life.

For now, lets accept that most types of learning also include other
types that often “go along for the ride.
” So, for the moment, we can
say that the general “map” of types of learning might include multiple

types.
 Now it becomes more obvious that what we learn is a lot easier
to understand than how we learn.
 This is because we often have no
way of knowing when exacdy learning is happening; we simply know
later that it did happen somehow (Loonis, Brincat, Antzoulatos, &
Miller, 2017).

What we can confidently say is that multiple inputs can create change
in the brain, indicating learning of some kind (Zatorre, Fields, &
Johansen-Berg, 2012).
 Knowing that every form of input is creating
change and learning in the brain is the beginning for you.
 You are now
learning how to be purposeful with the inputs you orchestrate for the
students in your class.
 Having said that, we all have to keep in mind
the bigger picture.
 The brain works like a world-class orchestra; different
instruments working together to produce the astounding effects.

In fact, under certain circumstances, learning involves nearly every
part of the brain.
 Figure 1.4 reminds you of how many areas of the
brain can learn.

Putting It All Together
Now that you have a basic understanding of the inputs, lets walk
through the process again and see how the other players we mentioned
earlier (context, input processes, systems, and structures)
become involved in a learning experience.

Lets take a look at sensory inputs and how the other players interact
with these kinds of triggers.
 You generate or receive sensory input in
CHAPTER 1
the form of something you see, smell, ras te, hear, or feel; your sense of
balance (proprioception), your sense of comfort, such as your level of
hunger (or satiation); and о chers.

These triggers activate a complex process that involves your sensory
systems sending information to your central nervous system.
 The
processes might involve somatosensory pathways, the stress-response
pathway, arren donai pathways, or cognitive systems that help your
brain create working memory.
 As you have learned, these systems
employ multiple structures in the brain.

The occipital lobe is primarily involved in processing and storing
visual sensory information (de Schotten, Urbanski, Vaiabregue,
Bayle, & Volle, 2014).
 The auditory cortex, temporal lobe, Wernicke’s
area, and Brocas area are involved with language, speech, and sound
(Friederici, 2017).
 The parietal lobe and cerebellum are active during
physical movement.
 The olfactory cortex is the brain structure most
associated with smell, while the gustatory cortex is the center for processing
and scoring information relating to taste (Fletcher, Ogg, Lu,
Ogg, & Boughter, 2017).

Beyond Explicit/Declarative Input
Remember that explicit inputs are initiated by life experiences—or
what we, as educators, might call direct instruction.
 Episodic learning
is usually rich in sensory information, and therefore our discussion
of sensory inputs involves che processes, systems, and structures outlined
above.
 It also often includes the brain’s emotional systems, headquartered
in the amygdala.
 Semantic learning, on rhe other hand, is
often less sense-enriched unless a teacher is highly skilled in the art of
differentiated instruction.
 A traditional lecture will only involve the
language systems and structures of the brain (i.
e., the parietal lobe,
the auditory cortex, Wernickes area, and Brocas area), with the occasional
inclusion of visual systems and structures (the occipital lobe)
when visual presentations are used.

All explicit and declarative memories are made through the hippocampal
areas in the medial temporal lobes.
 All explicit learning involves
the conscious atcencional systems of the brain.
 Implicit learning relies
on the brains ability to make associations between unrelated inputs
(Carpenter, Wills, Benattayallah, & Milton, 2016), like when you
first connected the three letters C-A-T to a four-legged fuzzy animal
with a long tail.
 Implicit and non-declarative inputs work with the
HOW THE BRAIN USUALLY LEARNS
brains unconscious systems, moderated mostly by the frontal cortex
and basal ganglia (Reber, 2013).

Summary
In its most simple form, here is how it generally works.
 Learning
always takes place somewhere, so it all starts with context.
 Then, triggers
activate a process that involves one or more systems operated by
various structures in the brain.
 Now, in the upcoming chapters, you’ll
be able to place this better into context and see how the many types of
learning, in the many circumstances, play out.
 More important, you’ll
learn how you can become far more effective in your work by working
with the brain, instead of against it.
